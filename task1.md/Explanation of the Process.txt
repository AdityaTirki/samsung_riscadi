Explanation of the Process in the Uploaded Screenshots:
: Leafpad Editor (sum1ton.c):

A simple C program is written to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to a given value n (in this case, n=5).
The logic of the program:
Variables i, sum, and n are declared and initialized.
A for loop adds numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) to the sum.
The result is printed using the printf function.
The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

: Terminal Compilation and Execution:
Compilation:
The program is successfully compiled using the gcc compiler.
Execution:
The compiled output file is executed using ./a.out.
The output shows: sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 15, which is the correct result for the sum of integers from 1 to 5.
Conclusion:
The C program correctly computes the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
The initial error was due to a missing file or wrong directory, which was fixed, and the program was compiled and executed successfully.
